 <p> <u> <b>The Project Proposal</b>
    </u>
    </p> 
<b>1. What is your website about?</b>
<p>
I am from Istanbul, Turkey and I decided to make my website a travel website for Istanbul. I will be including history of Istanbul, best restaurants, best places to visit, best hotels, things to do and tips before travelling.  
<p>
<b>2. What is the objective of your website? (Also read as why would this site be important?) </b></p>
My objective in the website is to educate people on Istanbul and provide information for people who want to travel to the city. I realized the lack of a good travel site for Istanbul. I will be providing information for a perfect travel to Istanbul from a local person's point of view.
<b><p>3. Who is your target audience set?</p></b>
My target audience is whomever wants to and is planning to travel to Istanbul and people who want to learn more about the city.
<p>
<b>4. What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</b>
</p>
I will be including history of Istanbul, best restaurants, best places to visit, best hotels, things to do and tips before travelling. In these pages I will be using many images and provide the information from a local person's point of view.

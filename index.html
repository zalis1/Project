    <B> <H2>HISTORY OF ISTANBUL </H2></B> 
        Istanbul, Turkish İstanbul, formerly Constantinople, ancient Byzantium, largest city and principal seaport of Turkey. It was the capital of both the Byzantine Empire and the Ottoman Empire. <p>The old walled city of Istanbul stands on a triangular peninsula between Europe and Asia. Sometimes as a bridge, sometimes as a barrier, Istanbul for more than 2,500 years has stood between conflicting surges of religion, culture, and imperial power. For most of those years it was one of the most coveted cities in the world.</p>
<p>The name Byzantium may derive from that of Byzas, leader of the Greeks from the city of Megara who, according to legend, captured the peninsula from pastoral Thracian tribes and built the town about 657 BCE. In 196 CE, having razed the town for opposing him in a civil war, the Roman emperor Septimius Severus rebuilt it, naming it Augusta Antonina in honour of his son. In 330 CE, when Constantine the Great dedicated the city as his capital, he called it New Rome. The coinage, nevertheless, continued to be stamped Byzantium until he ordered the substitution of Constantinopolis. At the end of the 1st millennium, Greek speakers were reported to refer to trips there as eis tēn polin, “into the City,” rather than “to Constantinople.” By the 13th century this Greek phrase had become an appellation for the city: Istinpolin. Through a series of speech permutations over a span of centuries, this name became Istanbul. Until the Turkish Post Office officially changed the name in 1930, however, the city continued to bear the millenary name of Constantinople. Pop. (2007) 10,757,327; (2017 est.) urban agglom., 14,744,519.

<H2><B>MONEY/CURRENCY</B></H2>
Since the 1st January 2009, the official currency in Turkey is the Turkish Lira (TL). This curency supplanted the New Turkish Lira, which was instituted in 2005 and that, following four years of use, changed name.
<p>There are currently bills of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 Turkish Lira. Coins are 1 Lira and 50, 25, 10, 5 and 1 kuru (100 kuru = 1 Lira) (https://www.introducingistanbul.com/currency).</p>
<p>One Euro is currently equal to 8.90142 Turkish Lira while one dollar is equal to 7.92 Turkish Lira. However, these numerals change daily therefore it is highly recommended to check the daily currency rate.

  <h2><b>LANGUAGE</b></h2>

</p>Turkish is the official language of Turkey, uniting not just its citizens, but also a diaspora of Turkish-speaking peoples throughout Asia. The Turkish language originated in the highlands of the Altay Mountains of central Asia and is heavily spoken in lands stretching from Turkey to China, including Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Özbekistan, Turkistan, Kazakhstan, Kirgizistan, Tajikistan, and Northern Cyprus. At the height of the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman language was a mélange of outside influences heavily infused with Arabic, the language of religion and law; Persian, the language of art and diplomacy; and French, well, just because it's French. Pure Turkish, spoken primarily in the home, was considered inappropriately informal and familiar for public use. (https://www.frommers.com/destinations/istanbul/in-depth/language)
